# Kickstarter-Analysis
### Module 1 Challenge
#### Final Kickstarter Analysis Submission for Module 1 Challenge Assignment
---
This analysis had two goals
1. To determine which launch dates had the most successful outcomes
2. To see if there is a correlation between goal funding and the outcome of the campaign
---
The graph below depicts campaign outcomes based on launch date. The launch dates are grouped into months.

The next graph shows how goal funding affected the outcome of the campaign.

Based on my analysis, I was able to draw several conclusions. 
* There is a positive correlation between when a campaign is launched, and its ultimate outcome. More successful campaigns were launched between the months of May-July. However, there was enough successful campaigns during Q2 and Q3 of a year, that it would best to stick within that 6 month time frame. Avoiding Q1 and Q4 is best. 
* The amount of goal funding directly impacts the ability for a campaign to succeed. Campaigns with the smallest amounts of goal funding have a higher percentage of success. The opposite is also true. Campaigns with larger amounts of goal funding hold a greater risk of failure and cancelation. There are campaigns with high goal amounts that succeeded and vice versa. 
* There were groups of goal funding that did not follow trend. A goal funding range of $40,000 to $44,999 had a %62.5 success rate, which was much higher than goal funding ranges between $5,000 to $39,000.

Although statistics show which factors are the most likely to lead a campaign into success, there is one glaring defect of this data. It does not portray the efficacy of the human leading the campaign. A campaign that has all the factors of success (its in a successful category, launched at the right time of year, only asking for a funding below 10K, etc) may still fail without the right human backing the project. It's the human leading the campaign that needs to produce backers and vouche for the project.

Another data set that would be helpful to analyze within kickstarter, would be to categorize locations by state and/or city. If running a theater campaign in the US, it would be helpful to know which cities/states have had the highest efficacy rates.
